# Demo Viem ü§ù Passkeys

This repo contains a sample application **for demonstration purposes only**, walking through how to create sub-organizations, create private keys, and sign with the [`@turnkey/viem`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/viem) signer, using passkeys. Please feel free to clone or fork this repo, or file an issue if there are improvements to be made! ‚ù§Ô∏è

The flow showcases 3 ways to make requests to Turnkey:

- the initial request to create a new [sub-organization](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/sub-organizations) is authenticated in the NextJS backend with an API signature (using `API_PUBLIC_KEY`/`API_PRIVATE_KEY` from your `.env.local` file)
- the request to log back in is signed on the frontend with your passkey, but it's passed to the NextJS backend as a signed request (the body, stamp, and url are POSTed). This lets the backend submit this request on your behalf, get your sub-organization ID, and fetch details about your wallet (parent organizations have read-only access to their sub-organizations).
- the request to sign a message is done 100% client-side via a Turnkey Viem signer (see [@turnkey/viem](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/viem)): it's signed with your passkey, and submitted from the browser to the Turnkey API directly.

If you want to see a Viem demo with API keys instead of passkeys, head to the example [`with-viem`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-viem). A demo using passkeys with Ethers can be found [here](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-ethers-passkeys). See our [SDK repo](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk) for additional packages and examples.

## Getting started

### 1/ Clone or fork this repo

Make sure you have `Node.js` installed locally; we recommend using Node v18+.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tkhq/demo-viem-passkeys.git
$ corepack enable  # Install `pnpm`
$ pnpm install # Install dependencies
$ pnpm run build  # Compile source code
```

### 2/ Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization and account. By following the [Quickstart](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/quickstart) guide, you should have:

- A public/private API key pair for Turnkey
- An organization ID

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new `.env.local` file. Notice that your API private key should be securely managed and **_never_** be committed to git.

```bash
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now open `.env.local` and add the missing environment variables:

- `API_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `API_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNKEY_API_BASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_ID`

### 3/ Running the app

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

This command will start a NextJS app on localhost. If you navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser, you can follow the prompts to create a sub organization, create a private key for the newly created sub-organization, and sign a message using your passkey with a Viem custom account!
